# Odd or Even Number Checker ğŸ§®

This is a simple Python script that determines whether a user-inputted integer is an **odd** or **even** number.

## ğŸš€ How It Works

- The program asks the user to enter an integer.
- It then checks the remainder when the number is divided by 2:
  - If the remainder is `1`, the number is **odd**.
  - If the remainder is `0`, the number is **even**.
- The result is printed to the screen.

## ğŸ’» Example Usage

```bash
Enter the integer: 7
7 is an odd number
